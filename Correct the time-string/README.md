# Correct the time-string

You have to create a method, that corrects a given time string. 
There was a problem in addition, so many of the time strings are broken. 
Time-Format is european. So from "00:00:00" to "23:59:59". 

Some examples:

"09:10:01" -> "09:10:01".
"11:70:10" -> "12:10:10".
"19:99:99" -> "20:40:39".
"24:01:01" -> "00:01:01".

If the input-string is null or empty return exactly this value! (empty string for C++)
If the time-string-format is invalid, return null. (empty string for C++)

Have fun coding it.
